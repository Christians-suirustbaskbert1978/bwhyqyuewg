Just stumbled out of Alarum and my head's spinning like one of those crazy old top toys. You know, the kind that never stops wobbling until it tumbles. The theater was alive with that buzzing chatter sound, like bees trapped in a jar, and I've still got popcorn crumbs clinging to me like a sad snack aftermath… But this movie. Man, it's like walking through a dream with bright flashing warning lights. That one scene where the protagonist stares into that cracked mirror had me going, like, is it me she's looking at? Or am I just the popcorn in this post-cinematic swirl?

> The bit where the rain just wouldn't stop, and there was this rhythmic drumming... Was it rain or something more mechanical? Like, does the universe have its own heartbeat? Am I getting too meta about this? Probably. My back's killing me from those theater seats, though. They never fit quite right, like they were built for some mythical creature with a very different lumbar support system. 

Download the movie and you'll feel it. Those colors, vibrant like a comic book and, yet, the vibe's almost melancholic. This one character, can't... remember her name. She's like a ghost or maybe a lingering scent of something sweet, something forgotten.

And that one line, she says something about time ticking like ants marching in a line... or was it sand? Maybe it was raisins? Ants make more sense. Watching it was like feeling someone light a fuse in my brain and waiting for it to burn down, to explode.

Remember someone asked if they should watch the movie, and in that surreal chase scene with the floating clocks, I thought, Yeah, watch it... Like a fever dream made entirely of broken guitar strings or a cat's cradle of thoughts you can't quite untangle.
